# FRONTEND INTEGRATION TEST

The goal of this test is to create the website in responsive design,
using the libraries and plugins that are inside the project, or newer versions of them.

You will go on this website :
http://www.recettesdesaison.com
To see how the website should behave (The animations, for example).

All of the things you need are inside the "assets" folder that is in the project.



**##INSTRUCTIONS**                                 

- 	The website must be responsive, and display perfectly on a desktop, tablet and mobile phone.

-	Try to be as close to the designs as possible, pixel perfect would be a plus.

-	For the CSS of the main page, use a combination of Bootstrap 4 and Flexboxes and Grid.

-	You will need to fork the project on Github.
